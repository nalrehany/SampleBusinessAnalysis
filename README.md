# SampleBusinessAnalysis
Here, I analyzed sample data of a company that wants to know various things from a rather dirty dataset, making easy questions beg for tedious solutions.

What was the best month for sales?
What cities had the highest output?
What time of day is best to show our ads?
What products are most often sold together?
What product is our star?
	
## What Was Used

* Python 3.9
* os
* glob
* plotly.express
* plotly.graph_objects
* itertools
* * combinations
* collections
* * Counter
 
## Key Data Manipulations
* Looping multiple csv's into one pandas data frame
* Stripping useless blank spaces in data
* Creating an interactive map with #plotly
* Using collections and itertools to find products sold together.

### Note
Credit to Keith Galli for the data and the solutions! This was quite the maniulation brain teaser.
